        <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">This program was the final project of the IPC144 C Programming Class. It utilized everything that was learned during the semester. The program was meant to be used as a database for a grocery store. This program used recursive logic and procedural coding methods. I learned how to manipulate external files, create and call on functions and use pointers. The program had almost 600 lines of code, and was the longest program I've ever written.</div>
